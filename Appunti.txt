You are a PHP expert, highly skilled in Javascript, jQuery and PHP advanced topics.
I want to create a PHP webapp which will be linked to a custom mySQL database; the module will let me load task templates from the custom database and will show a calendar on the left (70% of total window size) and a tasks list in the remaining space on the right.
The calendar will show the daily view by default and will let me switch to weekly and monthly view; the task list will show collapsible groups of tasks; tasks will have a description and two custom data (recorded on the database but not shown in the tasks list). I want to be able to drag-and-drop a task template from the list on the right to the calendar on the left: when the task is released, a modal window will show a form where I can edit the details of the calendar entry: the drag-and-drop action will define some data by default (date and start time are acquired by the drag-and-drop action, description and the two custom data are copied from the task which was drag-and-dropped; all data can be updated by the user in the form). The modal window must have two buttons ("OK" and "Cancel"): if Cancel is pressed then the form is closed without storing any data; if OK is pressed a calendar entry is created (start time and duration are defined via the data entered in the module; the calendar entry will show the description and the notes and will have a background color based on the selected category; if no category is selected, the background will be white) and the form data are saved on the database. Double-clicking the calendar event will let the user edit the event data, showing the previous form; clicking "OK" will update the database and the calendar event, clicking "Cancel" will abort the update operation. The calendar event must be draggable in the calendar: when dragged, the corresponding data (date and start time) in the database are updated consistently. The user must be able to stretch the calendar event dragging the upper and the lower border of the calendar event, updating consistently start date and end date of the event in the database. I will ask you to show me the code later; do you have any questions about the requirements?


, and grouping is handled by the custom database (there must be a main group which will be expanded by default, while secondary groups will be collapsed by default)

, other data (like the duration, likely to be set as 30 mins by default) will have a default value taken from the custom settings of each user, while some more data (the category, shown in a dropdown form element, taken from a list defined in the custom database; the notes, shown in a text form element; the tags, taken from a list defined in the custom database, shown in a form module where the user can select zero or more of the values) will have a specific form entry that the user can enter or not



Task List: You mentioned collapsible groups of tasks. Do these groups come from a database table, and if so, should the grouping logic be dynamic (based on database entries or categories)?
Modal Form: Besides description and custom data, will you need any additional fields like priority or location in the form?
Categories and Colors: Will the categories and their corresponding colors be predefined in the database, or should users be able to define them dynamically?
Dependencies: Are there any specific libraries or frameworks (like FullCalendar for the calendar and jQuery UI for drag-and-drop) that you want to use?
User Access: Should the application support multi-user access, and if so, do users need permissions to edit tasks and calendar entries?
Time Zones: Do you need support for different time zones, or is it safe to assume all users are in the same time zone?
Performance: Should the application handle a specific number of tasks/events without performance issues?
